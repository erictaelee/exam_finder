Create a Ruby on Rails API endpoint that accepts the following User information and abides by the following Acceptance Criteria:

Request parameters:

{
  first_name: String,
  last_name: String,
  phone_number: String,
  college_id: Integer,
  exam_id: Integer,

A client can send the above request and expect the following behavior

* A successful (200 OK) response if:
    * the request data is valid and sanitized

Architectural questions to consider:
Does the code function?
Is the code understandable?
Is the code maintainable? Modular?
Does the code have redundancy? Is there related code that can be deleted?
Does the code have performance issues?
Does the code have security vulnerabilities?
Is the code testable?
Is the code tested? (System/Unit)
Is it easy for developers to set up this project? (Seed data)
